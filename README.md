Course project for Getting and cleaning data
===============

Script run_analysis.R loads data form training and test data sets, merges them, adds "Activity" column, adds column names from "features.txt" and subsets columns which contains "mean()" or "std()". This should result in tidy data set, which is saved in file "tidy_data.txt" 
Initial data should be placed in folder "UCI HAR Dataset" in your working directory.
